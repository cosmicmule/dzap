Frontend Developer Test
==================

Instructions for Front End Dev Test

Clone/download the test from:
https://github.com/dzap/front-end-dev-test

Code the included mockup(psd and jpg versions included). Use the index.html we've included.
There are errors in the html, and in the javascript file we started for you. Fix them.
We're asking for a few things - so see below. Feel free to use plugins, or code from scratch.
If you can't accomplish something, then just skip it. At the very least, you should have all of the structure,
and styling in place. Let us know if you have questions or if anything is unclear.

Requirements:
- In header, code a slideshow
- Under "What Others are Saying" section, make that area pull in the content from either an xml or json feed.
- Solve the javascript puzzle in the app.js file.

What we are looking for:
- code structure and organization
- optimized for speed and best practices
- cross browser compatibility
- clean output in console

Bonus:
- Use a responsive framework
- Form validation
- improve usability

After completing the assessment, either zip up files, and them over, or you can push the test to your own repo.
